These functions allow the adrenal glands and gonads to synthesize both 17-alpha-hydroxylated glucocorticoids (via 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity) and sex steroids (via 17,20-lyase activity) ({8:Chung et al., 1987}; {22:Kagimoto et al., 1988}; {43:Van Den Akker et al., 2002})."

The deduced 508-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 57 kD. High-stringency screening of a human testicular cDNA library yielded a partial clone. RNA gel blots and nuclease S1-protection experiments showed that the adrenal and testicular P450C17 mRNAs are indistinguishable. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of P450C17 with 2 other human steroidogenic P450 cytochromes showed much greater homology with P450C21 ({613815}) (28.9%), another microsomal enzyme, than with P450SCC (12.3%), a mitochondrial enzyme.\n\n{36:Picado-Leonard and Miller (1987)} showed that the CYP17 and the CYP21B genes are very similar and presumably originated from a common ancestral gene. The 2 genes share an average homology of almost 30%, there being some regions of high homology and others of low homology. The main difference is that CYP17 has lost 2 exons present in CYP21B.\n\n{51:Youngblood et al. (1991)} isolated and characterized the mouse homolog."

                "textSectionContent": "{24:Krohn et al. (1992)} demonstrated that an autoantigen associated with Addison disease in the type I polyendocrine autoimmunity syndrome ({240300}) is steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase. Patients with type I polyendocrine disease without Addison disease did not show this autoantibody and patients with adult-type isolated Addison disease, like controls, also showed no reactivity.\n\n{39:Slominski et al. (1996)} presented evidence that the CYP17, CYP11A1 ({118485}), CYP21A2 ({613815}), and ACTHR ({202200}) genes are expressed in skin (see {202200}). The authors suggested that expression of these genes may play a role in skin physiology and pathology and that cutaneous proopiomelanocortin (POMC; {176830}) activity may be autoregulated by a feedback mechanism involving glucocorticoids synthesized locally.\n\nCYP17 expression in propagated theca cells isolated from the ovaries of women with PCO is persistently elevated, compared with theca cells isolated from normal ovaries. To investigate the mechanism for increased CYP17 mRNA accumulation in PCO theca cells, {44:Wickenheisser et al. (2000)} examined CYP17 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR; {600617}) promoter activities in normal and PCO theca cells. Basal and forskolin-stimulated CYP17 promoter activity was 4-fold greater in PCO cells than in theca cells isolated from normal ovaries. The authors concluded from these data that: (1) basal and cAMP-dependent CYP17 gene transcription is increased in PCO theca cells; (2) there is differential regulation of promoters of genes required for steroidogenesis in PCO theca cells; and (3) passaged normal and PCO theca cells provide a model system for studying tissue-specific regulation of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes and identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in increased androgen production in PCO.\n\nCorticosteroids have specific effects on cardiac structure and function mediated by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR ({138040}), respectively). Aldosterone and corticosterone are synthesized in rat heart. To see whether they might also be synthesized in the human cardiovascular system, {23:Kayes-Wandover and White (2000)} examined the expression of genes for steroidogenic enzymes as well as genes for GR, MR, and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B2; {614232}), which maintains the specificity of MR. Human samples were from left and right atria, left and right ventricles, aorta, apex, intraventricular septum, and atrioventricular node, as well as whole adult and fetal heart. Using RT-PCR, mRNAs encoding CYP11A, CYP21, CYP11B1 ({610613}), GR, MR, and HSD11B2 were detected in all samples except ventricles, which did not express CYP11B1. CYP11B2 ({124080}) mRNA was detected in the aorta and fetal heart, but not in any region of the adult heart, and CYP17 was not detected in any cardiac sample. Levels of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression were typically 0.1% those in the adrenal gland. The authors concluded that these findings are consistent with autocrine or paracrine roles for corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone, but not cortisol or aldosterone, in the normal adult human heart.\n\n{17:Hanley et al. (2001)} investigated the regulation of the human CYP17 gene by 2 orphan nuclear receptors, SF1 ({184757}) and DAX1 (NR0B1; {300473}). In human embryos, SF1 and DAX1 are expressed throughout the developing adrenal cortex from its inception at 33 days postconception. In contrast, CYP17 expression, which commences between 41 and 44 days postconception, is limited to the fetal zone. The 5-prime-flanking region of the human CYP17 gene contains 3 functional SF1 elements that collectively mediate 25-fold or greater induction of promoter activity by SF1. In constructs containing all 3 functional SF1 elements, DAX1 inhibited this activation by at least 55%. In the presence of only 1 or 2 SF1 elements, DAX1 inhibition was lost even though SF1 transactivation persisted. The authors concluded that efficient repression of SF1-mediated activation of the human CYP17 gene by DAX1 requires multiple SF1 elements.\n\n{26:Lin et al. (2001)} studied the transcriptional regulation of CYPC17. Expression of deletion mutants of up to 2,500 bp of human 5-prime-flanking DNA in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells indicated that most regulatory activity was confined to the first 227 bp. DNase I footprinting of the proximal promoter identified the TATA box, a steroidogenic factor-1 site, and 3 previously uncharacterized sites at -107/-85, at -178/-152, and at -220/-185. EMSAs and methylation interference assays suggested that the -107/-85 site and the -178/-152 site bind members of the nuclear factor-1 (NF1; see {600727}) family of transcription factors. Mutation of both the -107/-85 and the -178/-152 NF1 sites reduced basal transcription by half. Supershift assays showed that the ubiquitous proteins Sp1 ({189906}) and Sp3 ({601804}) both bind to the -227/-184 region and that mutation of their binding sites reduced transcription by 75%. Mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site plus the 2 NF1 sites eliminated almost all detectable transcription. The authors concluded that Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the -227/-184 site and NF1C proteins binding to the -107/-85 and the -178/-152 sites are crucial for adrenal transcription of the human gene for P450c17.\n\nCytochrome P450c17 catalyzes both 17-alpha-hydroxylation and 17,20-lyase conversion of 21-carbon steroids to 19-carbon precursors of sex steroids. In many species, the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 for one pathway dominates, reflecting the preferred steroidogenic pathway of that species. To elucidate the pathway leading to C19 testosterone precursors in the human testis, {14:Fluck et al. (2003)} assayed the conversion of 17-alpha-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (delta-5 17,20-lyase activity) and of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione (delta-4 17,20-lyase activity) by human fetal testicular microsomes. Apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) values indicated 11-fold higher preference for the delta-5 pathway. They concluded that the majority of testosterone biosynthesis in the human testis proceeds through the conversion of pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone via the delta-5 pathway."

The hydrophobic active site accommodates both delta-4 and delta-5 steroid substrates in a catalytically favorable orientation. The predicted contributions of positively charged residues to the redox-partner binding site were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Molecular dynamic simulations with pregnenolone, 17-OH-pregnenolone, progesterone, and 17-OH-progesterone docked into the substrate-binding pocket demonstrated that regioselectivity of the hydroxylation reactions is determined both by proximity of hydrogens to the iron-oxo complex and by the stability of the carbon radicals generated after hydrogen abstraction. The authors concluded that the model explains the activities of all known naturally occurring and synthetic human P450C17 mutants. The model also predicted that mutation of lys89 would disrupt 17,20-lyase activity to a greater extent than 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity."

                "textSectionContent": "<Subhead> 17-Alpha-Hydroxylase/17,20-Lyase Deficiency\n\nIn a patient with combined 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency ({202110}), {22:Kagimoto et al. (1988)} identified a 4-base duplication in the CYP17A1 gene ({609300.0001}), resulting in the loss of both enzymatic activities.\n\nBy Northern blot analysis of 6 patients with combined 17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase deficiency demonstrated by enzymatic activity of less than 2% for both enzymes, {45:Winter et al. (1989)} found abundant amounts of testicular RNA that hybridized to a cDNA specific for this P450 enzyme. Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed an apparently normal content of an immunoreactive protein with a molecular weight similar to that of an authentic P450(c17). These results suggested that the patients had a point mutation in the gene for P450 and that the mutant gene was transcribed, but gave rise to a protein defective in the enzyme activities.\n\nHuman male sexual differentiation requires production of fetal testicular testosterone, whose biosynthesis requires steroid 17,20-lyase activity. The existence of true isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency has been questioned because 17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities are catalyzed by a single enzyme, microsomal cytochrome P450c17, and because combined deficiencies of both activities were found in a patient thought to have had isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency. In 2 patients with isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency from a small village in Brazil, {15:Geller et al. (1997)} identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the CYP17A1 gene ({609300.0012}; {609300.0013}). When expressed in COS-1 cells, the mutant proteins retained 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity, but had minimal 17,20-lyase activity. Substrate competition experiments suggested that the mutations did not alter the enzyme's substrate-binding capacity, but cotransfection of cells with P450 oxidoreductase, the electron donor used by P450c17, indicated that the mutants had a diminished ability to interact with redox partners. Computer graphic modeling of the enzymes suggested that both mutations lay in or near the redox-partner binding site, on the opposite side of the heme from the substrate-binding pocket. {15:Geller et al. (1997)} concluded that these mutations alter electrostatic charge distribution in the redox-partner binding site, so that the electron transfer for the 17,20-lyase reaction is selectively lost or diverted to uncoupling reactions. The authors stated that these were the first proven cases of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency and represented a novel mechanism for loss of enzymatic activity. Up to that time 18 CYP17 mutations had been found in 28 patients; all mutations had affected the 2 activities equally. These observations can be added to those in Hurler syndrome ({607014}), metachromatic leukodystrophy ({250100}), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A ({253600}), which led {52:Zlotogora et al. (1996)} to suggest that multiple mutations in a single gene in a restricted population may be a common phenomenon.\n\n<Subhead> Other Hormonal Associations\n\n{6:Carey et al. (1993)} described families in which the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO; {184700}) and premature male pattern baldness (MPB; {109200}) segregated as an autosomal dominant phenotype. {7:Carey et al. (1994)} studied 14 Caucasian families with 81 affected individuals and identified a -34T-C transition (A1 and A2 alleles, respectively) in the 5-prime promoter region of the CYP17 by heteroduplex analysis. The change created an additional SP1-type (CCACC box) promoter site that was thought to cause increased expression of the gene. The base change also created a recognition site for the restriction enzyme MspA1, allowing a simple screening procedure. There was a significant association between the A2 allele and the affected state for consecutively identified Caucasian women with PCO as compared either to consecutively matched controls or to a random population. Within the 14 families, members with polycystic ovaries or male pattern baldness had a significant association with the occurrence of at least 1 A2 allele compared to their normal relatives. The A2 allele did not cosegregate, however, with the affected phenotype in families showing association, demonstrating that the mutation in CYP17 is not the cause of PCO/MPB. Although variation represented by the A2 allele (-34C) of the CYP17 gene appeared to be a significant factor modifying the expression of PCO/MPB in families in which the phenotype was demonstrated to segregate as a single gene disorder, it was excluded as the primary genetic defect. {34:Nedelcheva Kristensen et al. (1999)} showed that the -34T-C polymorphism did not bind to SP1 ({189906}).\n\nIn a study to identify genetic factors affecting the onset of menarche and natural menopause in healthy postmenopausal Japanese women, {16:Gorai et al. (2003)} found that ages at menarche in women with the CYP17 genotype A1/A2 (higher activity of CYP17) were significantly earlier than in those with A1/A1 (lower activity of CYP17). There were no significant differences in age at natural menopause and years of menstruation among each CYP17, CYP1A1 ({108330}), or COMT ({116790}) genotype. The authors concluded that these results suggest that the estrogen-metabolizing CYP17 genotype influences age at menarche in healthy postmenopausal Japanese women.\n\nIn a genotype/haplotype association study involving a case-control sample of 1,117 brothers from 506 sibships with prostate cancer, {28:Loukola et al. (2004)} did not detect any associations with CYP17A1.\n\n{10:Costa-Santos et al. (2004)} described what they believed to be the first 2 cases of 17-hydroxylase deficiency resulting from mutations that alter splice acceptor sites ({609300.0034}, {609300.0035}). They provided direct evidence that the mutations disrupted mRNA splicing and that negligible active enzyme was produced from the alleles with the intronic mutations.\n\nAmong 153 Caucasian males, {38:Schulze et al. (2008)} found that the CYP17 A2 allele was associated with increased urinary excretion of epitestosterone glucuronide and its putative precursor 5-androstene-3-beta,17-alpha-diol. Those homozygous for A1/A1 had a 64% higher testosterone/epitestosterone ratio compared to those with an A2 allele. The findings indicated that CYP17 is involved in the production of epitestosterone. {38:Schulze et al. (2008)} concluded that the CYP17 promoter polymorphism may partly explain high natural testosterone/epitestosterone levels, which may have important implications for androgen testing in athletes."

A 156-bp segment of the inserted sequence showed 95.5% identity to the nuclear antigen-binding site on Marek disease virus DNA and sequences found in rearranged mitochondrial DNA of rat hepatoma cells. A similar degree of sequence identity (99%) was also found between the above sequences and part of the lac operon of E. coli. The mutated gene encoded a truncated nonfunctional steroid hydrolase. Two genotypically and phenotypically female sisters were also affected and had the same mutation. Both parents were heterozygous. The inserted sequence was not found in DNA from normal individuals or in the CYP17 gene of other Italian patients with 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. This suggested that the mutation resulted from a sporadic event affecting an ancestor of this family and was not caused by transposition of genomic DNA. {3:Biason et al.

She had experienced menarche at age 13; menstrual cycles were regular until age 18 and irregular thereafter, and she was known to be infertile. Pubic hair was present (Tanner stage 3), and breast maturation was within normal range (Tanner stage 5). Resting blood pressure was normal, and hypokalemia was not observed despite high blood corticosterone levels and reduced plasma renin activity. Analysis of the CYP17 gene revealed a homozygous T-to-A transversion at nucleotide position 2472 in exon 3 of the CYP17A1 gene that resulted in a tyr201-to-asn (Y201N) amino acid change. In vitro expression of the mutated Y201N enzyme revealed reduced activities of both 17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase; however, these reductions were less than those of the F53/54del mutation ({609300.0002}), which also shows mild clinical deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase. {42:Taniyama et al.
