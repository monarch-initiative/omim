    """
    From the OMIM documentation:  What do the symbols preceding a MIM number represent?

    An asterisk (*) before an entry number indicates a gene.

    A number symbol (#) before an entry number indicates that it is a descriptive entry, usually of a phenotype, and
    does not represent a unique locus. The reason for the use of the number symbol is given in the first paragraph of
    he entry. Discussion of any gene(s) related to the phenotype resides in another entry(ies) as described in the
    first paragraph.

    A plus sign (+) before an entry number indicates that the entry contains the description of a gene of known
    sequence and a phenotype.

    A percent sign (%) before an entry number indicates that the entry describes a confirmed mendelian phenotype or
    phenotypic locus for which the underlying molecular basis is not known.

    No symbol before an entry number generally indicates a description of a phenotype for which the mendelian basis,
    although suspected, has not been clearly established or that the separateness of this phenotype from that in
    another entry is unclear.

    A caret (^) before an entry number means the entry no longer exists because it was removed from the database or
    moved to another entry as indicated.

    See also the description of symbols used in the disorder column of the OMIM Gene Map and Morbid Map.
